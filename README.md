[![SparkX STC31 Breakout (Qwiic) (SPX-nnnnn)]()](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/nnnnn)

[*SparkX STC31 Breakout (Qwiic) (SPX-nnnnn)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/nnnnn)

An Arduino library for the STC3x family of CO<sub>2</sub> sensors from Sensirion. The STC31 uses Sensirion’s patented CMOSens® sensor technology to measure CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations up to 100%.

We've written this Arduino library to make reading the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration very easy. It can be downloaded through the Arduino Library manager: search for 'SparkFun STC3x'.

Library written by Paul Clark, based on the SCD30 library by Nathan Seidle ([SparkFun](http://www.sparkfun.com)).
